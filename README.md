Directions:

1. Download Python 3.10.7 (64bit) or (32bit) whichever your PC takes.    Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/
2. Download Pycharm from Google
3. Download my code in a zip file, now Extract the file using Winrar (If you don't have it just download it from Google) Click extract to whatever the "file name is"
4. Then move the Extracted files to Pycharm's projects file in C:/Users/Dell/PycharmProjects      (Obviously, if it's a different computer than not Dell)
5. Download Chrome Webdriver from Google
6. Make sure to add Chrome Webdriver to PATH, Here is a video      Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO64s7TYbOk
7. Now open up my Tinderbot file in Pycharm and add it into a Virtual environment, Below are instructions:

Open the Project in PyCharm:

Go to File > Open, and select the folder containing the code you downloaded.
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
In Pycharm go to File > Settings > Project: <project name> > Python Interpreter.

When you click "Add Interpreter" and see the "Add Local Interpreter" option, select it.
Select Virtualenv Environment:

In the window that opens, you should see an option to create a new virtual environment
Choose "Virtualenv Environment."
Create a New Virtual Environment:

New environment: This is recommended as it isolates the dependencies for your project.
Location: PyCharm will suggest a default location for the new virtual environment. You can accept the default or specify a different directory.
Base interpreter: Choose the Python version installed on your system (e.g., Python 3.x). This will be used as the base for the new virtual environment.
Click "OK" to create the new virtual environment.

8. Go to a Login_details file That came with the TiderBot file and make sure you put in your Facebook login that's connected with your Tinder account.

9. Now go back to your TinderBot file and in the terminal window type "pip install Selenium"

10. Lastly go ahead. and run the file on the top right of the screen that looks like a play icon button 

11. Enjoy, if any popups come on the screen make sure you close them on your own by clicking on X
